# Loan Approval Prediction Project

This project aims to predict loan approval outcomes using machine learning techniques. We used a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which included both training and test datasets. The data required preprocessing to handle missing values and then utilized various machine learning libraries for prediction. Additionally, we visualized the dataset and model results using Matplotlib.

## Dataset

We sourced our dataset from Kaggle, which included two main files: a training dataset and a test dataset. These datasets were used to train and validate our machine learning models.

## Preprocessing

Before applying machine learning techniques, we preprocessed the data to handle missing values. Various methods were employed to impute or remove missing values, ensuring the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.

## Machine Learning

We employed popular machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn, to build predictive models for loan approval. By using techniques like classification algorithms, we made predictions based on the processed data.

## Visualization

To gain insights into the dataset and the model's predictions, we utilized Matplotlib, a powerful visualization library in Python. Visualizations were created to represent various aspects of the data and the model's performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed. The project relies on the following libraries:

- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
